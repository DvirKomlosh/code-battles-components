Welcome to Code Battles's documentation!
========================================

**Code Battles** is a React/PyScript library for creating interactive competitive coding battles.

The battles consist of teams, which work on their bots for a game you implement (such as Bloons TD Battles, Snake or anything you else can imagine).
This library enables you to create such an activity **without** having to do any web development. You need only implement the game and API of your specific game.

.. warning::
    This library is currently in very early stages.
